**If you opened this vault and everything is out of order, you might need to trigger the sorting once (see below).**

This vault uses the plugin Custom File Explorer Sorting instead of numbers to sort the files. To sort any file and folder, right click and add it to a bookmark, under bookmark group, select the SORT ORDER group. Then in the bookmark tab, rearrange them how you'd want it to sort. After that open the command pallete (`Ctrl + P`) and type in "Sort on" and press enter.
