## Webpages

You can use a browser extension that's available on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/) and [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle?pli=1) called SingleFile to capture an `.html` file. You can then directly view it in this vault! See [[Combine Zettelkasten and BASB.html]]

## Other Attachments

You can put [[You can edit this code.jsx|codes]] and [[You can view this Word Doc.docx|word docs]] directly in your projects and see them directly in Obsidian as well!
